        <strong><a href="https://github.com/mattanelkaim/Network.py/tree/master/TRIVIA%20GAME">TRIVIA GAME</a></strong> - Summary project. Creating the <em>chatlib</em> protocol, a protocol that allows  to transfer commands & data between clients and the server.
        <br>
        Also experimenting with a lot of modules, such as <em>requests</em> to get questions from a web service, <em>json</em> to organize the server data, <em>hashlib</em> to create unique IDs for each question, <em>select</em> to handle multiple TCP clients and <em>logging.</em>
        <br>
        The server allows connections within its subnet.
    </li>
</ul>
